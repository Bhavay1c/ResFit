                <p>
                    The ESP32 microcontroller plays a central role in ResiFit, handling wireless communication between the device and the mobile app via Bluetooth. This enables users to adjust resistance levels directly from their phones. The ESP32 controls a motor system that regulates the tension of resistance bands, which are coiled and connected through the user's arms, allowing for dynamic adjustments in resistance to match workout intensity.
                    
                    These motor-driven resistance bands provide variable resistance that simulates the feel of traditional weightlifting but with added portability and adjustability. By increasing or decreasing motor tension, users can progressively challenge their muscles, building strength in real time while performing skill-based movements. The bands, powered by the motor's precise adjustments, enable a smooth, controlled range of motion, allowing athletes to enhance their strength without sacrificing the skills integral to their sports. This combination of ESP32 control, motor precision, and adjustable resistance bands makes ResiFit a versatile training tool for customized workouts.</p>

                <p>This 3D diagram represents the main structural component of the ResiFit device, which serves as the central hub where all primary components attach, including the motor, ESP32 microcontroller, and resistance bands. This part is designed to integrate seamlessly with the vest, securely holding all the elements in place and allowing the device to deliver resistance while keeping the components stable during movement.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Top and middle sections:</strong> These sections likely house the motor and control mechanisms that manage resistance adjustments, driven by signals from the ESP32 microcontroller.</li>
                    <li><strong>Base structure:</strong> This is where the ESP32 and power supply could be mounted, with openings or supports to hold wires and components in alignment.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This central part ensures that ResiFit functions as a cohesive unit, with each component optimally positioned for performance and user comfort.</p>

                <h2>Mobile App</h2>
                <img src="Images/app.png" alt="Mobile App">
                <p>The companion app offers a user-friendly interface for adjusting workout intensity, tracking progress, and monitoring real-time feedback.</p>
            </div>

            

            <h2>How Does ResiFit Work?</h2>
            <p>ResiFit integrates motor-controlled resistance bands via the ESP32, wrapping around the arms to offer adjustable resistance. The app communicates with the microcontroller to set the desired resistance, delivering a customized and effective workout experience.</p>
