            <h1>Technical Overview of ResiFit</h1>
            <p>ResiFit is built with a combination of advanced hardware and software components designed to deliver a seamless workout experience. Here’s a breakdown of the technical components:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>ESP32 Microcontroller:</strong> Handles wireless communication with the mobile app via Bluetooth and controls the motor system to adjust the resistance in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Motor-Driven Resistance Bands:</strong> The resistance is provided by coiled strings that loop through the arms and adjust tension based on the motor’s control, which is customizable via the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Bluetooth Connectivity:</strong> The device connects to your smartphone through Bluetooth, providing real-time feedback and enabling resistance customization.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile App:</strong> The companion app is designed to provide a user-friendly interface, allowing users to adjust workout intensity, track progress, and monitor feedback in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> The device is powered by a rechargeable battery, providing hours of continuous use with energy-efficient motor controls.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How Does ResiFit Work?</h2>
            <p>ResiFit integrates resistance bands controlled via a motor connected to the ESP32. The bands wrap around your arms, offering adjustable resistance as you move. The app communicates with the microcontroller to set the desired resistance level, ensuring a customized and effective workout experience.</p>
